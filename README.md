This extension checks the links
in your website. It can check all kinds of links:
Links to page, content elements, external and file links.

Automatic checking can be configured via console command.

**Important:** Support for TYPO3 9 was dropped, it is recommended to use
brofix with TYPO3 10 or higher.

**Credit:** This extension is based on the TYPO3 core extension linkvalidator,
it was forked from the source. Thus, previous work has been used. Thanks goes
to the original authors and maintainers in the core, without whom this work
would not have been possible.
