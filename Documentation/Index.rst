Broken Link Fixer checks the links on your website, generates a report
and allows you to edit entries with broken links directly from the report
in the TYPO3 backend.

It can check all types of links: Links to pages, records, external URLs
and file links. This task can be executed in the TYPO3 backend via the
TYPO3 :doc:`Scheduler <ext_scheduler:Index>` or via the command line
and supports sending a status mail when broken links are detected.
