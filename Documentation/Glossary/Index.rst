false positives
   These are URL which were falsely detected as broken. They are valid
   URLs which Broken Link Fixer detects as broken.

on-the-fly checking
   "On-the-fly" checking means almost immediate link checking as soon as
   the record is saved. This is in contrast to periodic link checking via
   the console command.

stale links
   These are links, where the link status is "stale", meaning it may be
   outdated. This can be a problem in the case of stale broken links which
   are shown as broken in the list, while the record has already been updated
   and the broken link fixed.
